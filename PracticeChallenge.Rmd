## Introduction

In this document, we will be exploring the Gapminder dataset

## Observations of Gapminder

### Countries with life expectancy less than 30

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp<30)
```
Only **two** such countries

### Countries with life expectancy greater than 81

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(lifeExp>81)
```

There are *five* such countries


### Life expectancy by continent in 2007


```{r}
gapminder2<- gapminder %>% filter(year==2007)
boxplot(lifeExp~continent,data=gapminder2)
```
I worked out how to get the year from the solutions! i feel
 
* Happy

* Relieved
